script that checks if hussein and the prime time uploaded a new video
saves the title and url on a DB(TBD)
prints on a discrod server as a discord bot the url for the fetched videos
maybe later takes in parameters to query all stored videos and filter by channel?

make it rest AND graphql?

------

use typescript
make in class based
consume youtubes api
youtube api to fetch channel id using its name
format date as needed in youtubes api
youtube api to fetch latest video using channel id
fectching several videos because of how the youtube api works
filter the newest one with ID and return it
add interfaces to avoid using any as datatype for the videos
save data to mongodb to keep track of all the bot has done
mongodb because is easy to setup in a free cloud
add discord bot client
connect with a discord server
add discord slash commands
remove dummy slash commands
refactor slash command to fetch videos using youtube api and store in database
remove utils directory and relocate those functions under respective classes
make fetching videos work out of a list of channels and not just 1
add ci/cd github actions
